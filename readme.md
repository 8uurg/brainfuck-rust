# Brainfuck Interpreter in Rust
In order to try out a new language, why not write an interpreter?

Turns out it is a pretty fun way to learn parts of a programming language.
The current code uses `match` statements, `enums`, and shows off `iterators`.

A few optimizations can still be performed, and will probably be done to play around with it:

[ ] Group instructions together <br/>
[ ] Precompute pointers for loops, rather than doing this on the fly. <br/>
[ ] In some special cases of loops
